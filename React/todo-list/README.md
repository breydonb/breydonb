# ReactJS Todo List

I cannot stress that this is a Version 1.0 of a very basic ReactJS todo list. The point of making this is for me to understand the React hooks like useState, useRef, and useEffect. Along with this, I used ReactBootstrap to handle the forms for the Todo List to minimize the amount of HTML I was writing.

## General Purpose and Scope of this list

With this list, the user is able to store tasks that may need to be done by using the useState hook and various other functions. These functions include: edit, delete, add, and complete functions. 

As of right now, user data gets removed once the webpage is refreshed, but see the tasks to see when that is getting worked on.

## Sources for this project

While I didn't use many different sources, here are some that I found useful:

- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)

## Future Plans with this project

Here are some of the tasks that I plan on doing to do for this project (Ironic I'm using GitHub and not the Todo List that I built :upside_down_face:):


- [] Develop an API and store tasks in database
- [] Dockerize an environment
- [] Host this on Firebase
- [] Find applicable uses for this in my daily life
- [] Tags for categorization :eyes::eyes::eyes:
