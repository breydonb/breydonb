					<p>This is one of the only games I make time to play now. I have been playing this game since December of last year. I am about 25% into the game but I've already defeated Ganon. If I have nothing to do, I will most likely be playing this game. Overall, this game isn't my favorite because I only recently started playing.</p>

					<p>This is my all time favorite game to play as a kid and as an adult. I have completed the game twice and 100%ed the game once. I wish I had more time, because I would load up my emulator and play this game.</p>
