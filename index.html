      <h1>One of my favorite games ever created is Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h1>
      <p> I started playing Zelda when I was about 7 or 8 years old. I had fond memories of playing Ocarina of Time on the N64 in my parent's bedroom. So naturally , I was freaking stoked when they announced Breath of the Wild for the Switch. I waited until Christmas of last year to finally get my hands on a Switch and the deluxe edition of the game. I am currently trying to get 100% in the entire game even though I'm only 25%. </p>
