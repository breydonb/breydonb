This section of my GitHub is done entirely in my own free time. This is to deminstrate polymorphism, interfaces & abstract classes, data structures, and other various OOP ideas and concepts.

## Newton's Approximation of Square Roots

While this is a very simple problem, this is a very interesting approximation of square roots. The program takes two parameters (but can take three once modified), the **guess** and the **input number**. 

The function returns a floating point number and uses the equation `approximation = 0.5 * (guess + ( input / guess)`. The program then iterates through to check if the rounded approximation is equal to the rounded answer. If true, it returns the rounded approximation variable.

## Polymorphic Car Problem

This program shows the power of polymorphism by taking the `PolymorphicCar` interface and various car classes and changes the output returned by the driver class.
